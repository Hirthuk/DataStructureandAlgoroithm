Datastructure - How to store the Data
Algorithm - How to manipulated and retrive data in the Datastructure.

A **data structure** is a way of organizing, storing, and managing data 
efficiently to enable easy access, modification, and usage. It provides a structured format 
for solving computational problems effectively, 
such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs.

Usage of different Datastructure because each has it's own functionality mainly depends on 3 -

Readble, Time complexity, space complexity
Time complexity - CPU
Space complexity - RAM(In memory storage), Persistent storage.

Operations Done in different Datastructure;
Insertion
Deletion
Sorting
Traversal - Going through all the elements in the DS(Datastructure)
Accessing 

Each Datastructure will have different functionality based on operations.
Some might be best in searching and some might be best with Insertion

Some language have inbuilt different datastrcutre and we can create also
