In JavaScript, reference types refer to objects and arrays that store references to the memory 
location where the actual data is stored, rather than storing the data itself directly in the variable.

When you assign a reference type (e.g., an object or array) to a variable, the variable doesnâ€™t hold 
the actual object itself.
Instead, it holds a reference (or pointer) to the location in memory where the object is stored.
