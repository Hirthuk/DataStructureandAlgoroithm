What is good code
Readable - Understandable by others
Scalable - By use of BigO We can check whether it is Scalable.

By use of BigO We can measure the performance and scalablity of the code

Big-O notation is used to measure the complexity of an algorithm, 
specifically in terms of its performance as the size of its input grows. It measures the performance and how many
operations will the code use to do certain things.

O(n) -- Explanation

In Big-O notation, 
O(n) represents linear time complexity.

Key Characteristics:
Growth: The algorithm's runtime grows proportionally to the size of the input n.
Behavior: For each additional input element, the algorithm performs one additional basic operation.
Example: Parctice.js File
A simple for loop iterating over an array of 
n=1,000, it takes 1,000 steps.
